# Selections
#
# Selections are pseudo-collections of entries. You may want to group disparate
# entries together across many collections. Selections is a way to do that.
# Lifer includes some basic selections but you can also create your own by
# writing a simple Ruby class. See the `Lifer::Selection` class documentation for
# more information.
#
selections:
  - lifer/selection/all_markdown
  - lifer/selection/included_in_feeds

# Global settings
#
# These settings are special, and they're used for all of your collections and
# cannot be set per collection.
#
# Note that the `build:` and `prebuild:` keys can be configured to work
# differently per environment (`build` or `serve`):

# Valid:

#    #     build:
#    #       - final_minified_build_assets_command
